[{"content":"Disqus brings the power of commenting to the Awake template. It provides features like moderation, reactions, filtering, and social sharing out of the box. Best of all, it's free and super easy to setup!\n\n## Step 1\n\nGo to disqus.com and click on \"Get Started\"\n\n![Screenshot of Disqus homepage](/uploads/disqus-get-started.jpg)\n\n## Step 2\n\nChoose \"I want to install Disqus on my site\"\n\n![Disqus button \"I want to install Disqus on my site\"](/uploads/disqus-add-to-website.jpg)\n\n## Step 3\n\nSign-up or sign in\n\n## Step 4\n\nEnter site name, Disqus URL and select a category. The Disqus URL name is your siteâ€™s name in your account where you can access all the required settings.\n\n## Step 5\n\nSelect a plan. There are several premium versions available, but don't worry the free one works just great too!\n\n## Step 6\n\nDisqus supports a number of different platforms but also works great in static sites like Awake. Scroll to the very bottom of the list and choose: \"I don't see my platform listed, install manually with\"\n\n![Disqus button \"I don't see my platform listed, install manually with\"](/uploads/disqus-platform-button.jpg)\n\n## Step 7\n\nYou can ignore everything on this page, as the Awake template has already configured it for you. All you have to do is find your \"Site Short Name\" (it's the first part of the url) and add it to `config/_siteConfig.js`.\n\nTake it from here:\n\n![Site Short Name in url](/uploads/disqus-site-short-name.jpg)\n\nand put it here:\n\n```\n// config/_siteConfig.js\nexport default {\n...\n// Disqus\n  disqus: {\n    on: false,\n    siteShortName: 'testing-bjsj2bjl0i'\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## Step 8\n\nThat's it! You've got comments up and running on your site. Go checkout a post and see you new fancy comments section.\n","isEmpty":false,"excerpt":"","title":"Disqus","subtitle":"Awake Supports Commenting on Posts","category":"category 1","author":"Daniel Kelly","date":"2019-07-24T19:59:59.000Z","featureImage":"/uploads/disqus-hero.jpg","slug":"disqus-on-awake"},{"content":"Awake is a Nuxt.js template for generating a beautifully robust static site with blog in as few steps as possible. \n\n# Features\n\n* Simple modern design based on the Bulma css framework\n* Site search\n* Statically generated API for posts and categories\n* Disqus powered comments\n* Mailchimp powered newsletter\n* Highly customizable with out of the box configurations\n* Built with performance in mind\n* Isolated Netlify CMS driver (with more CMS drivers planned for future) for easily migrating between various headless cms'\n\nDeploy to Netlify Button Here\n\n# Configuration\n\nSite configuration is found in `/config/_siteConfig.js`.
